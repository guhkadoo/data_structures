# Trees Data Structures

The **trees** directory contains various tree-based data structures, each serving different purposes in computing and algorithm design. Trees are hierarchical data structures that are widely used in searching, sorting, and efficient data storage.

## Included Tree Structures

- **Binary Tree** – A tree where each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)** – A data structure for efficiently computing prefix sums.
- **Expression Tree** – A tree representation of mathematical expressions.
- **Heap** – A specialized tree-based structure used for priority queues.
- **Huffman Tree** – A tree used in data compression (Huffman coding).
- **Segment Tree** – A tree for range queries and updates.

Each subdirectory contains:
- Implementations in C or C++.
- Example usage (main file).
