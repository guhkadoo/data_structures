# Sorting Algorithms

The **sorting** directory contains implementations of various sorting algorithms, each with different time and space complexities. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science used to arrange data in a particular order (ascending or descending).

### **Algorithms Included**

- **Bubble Sort** â€“ A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order.
- **Heap Sort** â€“ An efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap to sort elements in O(n log n) time.
- **Insertion Sort** â€“ A comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- **Merge Sort** â€“ A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort** â€“ A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, recursively sorting them.
- **Radix Sort** â€“ A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that processes each digit of the numbers starting from the least significant digit (LSD).
