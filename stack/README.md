# Stack

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. This means that the last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in expression evaluation, backtracking, and function call management.

## ðŸ”„ Implemented Stack Features

### âœ… Implemented:
1. **Basic Stack Operations**
   - **Push**: Add an element to the stack.
   - **Pop**: Remove and return the top element.
   - **Peek**: Get the top element without removing it.
   - **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
   - **isFull** (for fixed-size implementations).

2. **Shunting Yard Algorithm**
   - Converts an infix expression into postfix notation.
   - Used for evaluating arithmetic expressions.
