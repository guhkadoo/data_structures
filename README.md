# Data Structures Repository

This repository is a collection of various **data structures** implemented in C/C++. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning resource for understanding the core concepts and algorithms behind fundamental data structures, such as **stacks**, **queues**, **trees**, **graphs**, and more.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate the implementation of common data structures.
- Showcase how these data structures are used in practice.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific data structure. Each subdirectory contains:
- A `README.md` with an explanation of the data structure.
- Code examples showing how to implement and use the data structure.

### Directories:
- **binary_search**: Implementation and explanation of Binary Search.
- **hash_table**: Implementation and explanation of the Hash Table data structure.
- **linked_lists**: Different types of linked lists (e.g., singly, doubly linked lists).
- **pattern_searching**: Different pattern searching algorithms such as Naive String Matching, Rabin-Karp,
    Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Aho-Corasick.
- **queue**: Implementation and explanation of the Queue data structure.
- **sort**: Different sorting algorithms such as Bubble, Insertion, Heap, Merge, Quick and Radix sort. 
- **stack**: Implementation and explanation of the Stack data structure.
- **trees**: Various tree structures such as Binary Tree, Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree), Expression Tree, Heap,
    Huffman Tree and Segment Tree .
- **graphs**: Graph representations and traversal algorithms.

## Getting Started

No installation is required! Simply browse through the directories to explore the data structures and their implementations.
